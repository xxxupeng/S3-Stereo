<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Top.</strong> Illustration of learning behaviors in occluded regions: (a) Photometric loss takes a shortcut by copying disparities from nearby visible areas; (b) Occlusion-masked photometric loss (masked-PL) fails to supervise occlusion completion, leaving these regions poorly estimated; (c) Our S$^3$ accurately predicts disparities even in heavily occluded areas. <strong>>Bottom.</strong> S$^3$ achieves outstanding unsupervised performance on the (d) KITTI 2015~\cite{KITTI2015} and (e) KITTI 2012~\cite{KITTI2012} benchmarks, as well as zero-shot generalization in (f).
